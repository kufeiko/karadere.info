# Technical documentation

The website is built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and is hosted on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/). This setup delivers an improved web presence based on the so called [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/).

Better performance, security, accessiblity and easiness to maintain infrastructure of tools.

## Getting started

We are grateful you are interested into the technical details of the project. Probably you are here in order to figure out how to contribute and that's great!

**Requirements**

- Node.js (8.10.x or higher)
- yarn >= 1.x

We recommend you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

```sh
# Install a specific version.
nvm install

# Use a specific version.
nvm use
```

## Get dependencies

Either run:

```sh
npm install
```

Or if you have `yarn`:

```sh
yarn
```

## Start project locally

This is the command:

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) server and a watch task for changes in HMR mode provided by Gatsby.js.

Changing your code, you will see changes reflect on the website immediately without page reload.

## Build project

This is the command:

```sh
yarn build
```

When the process is ready, there will be a folder `public` which you can upload on any hosting which can work with static assets.
